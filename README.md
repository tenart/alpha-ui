# Alpha UI

Front end React source code for the Slide Information Management web app. Developed by team Alpha for UNC Health as part of [COMP 523](https://comp523.cs.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill.

## Getting Started

### `npm install`

This is a standard React project and requires [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). Clone the repository as usual and `cd` into it. Run `npm install` to install the required node modules.

## Create React App Basics

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
